# sqlalchemy-challenge
In step one of this project, I was tasked with using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic analysis and data exploration of a climate database using SQLAlchemy, ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 
In step two, I was tasked with designing a Flask API based on the queries that were developed in step one.
