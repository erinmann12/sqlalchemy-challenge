# sqlalchemy-challenge
**Background**

I was tasked with analyzing climate data in Honolulu, Hawaii, to inform my fictional trip there. 

**Tools Used**

1. Python
2. SQLAlchemy
3. ORM Queries
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Flask API

**Project Tasks**

In step one of this project, I was tasked with using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic analysis and data exploration of a climate database using SQLAlchemy, ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This included using SQLAlchemy to connect to the sqlite database and reflecting tables into classes.

After the initial analysis was done, I created two different maps with Matplotlib.

In step two, I was tasked with designing a Flask API based on the queries that were developed in step one.
